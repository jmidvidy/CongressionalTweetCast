"\"Never lose sight of the fact that this is a business. The loyalty is to the position, not to the person\""
"The former Televisa employee said that the network was happy to promote EPN when \"he was the best product,\" BUT NOT long term commitment"
"\"The network has also announced that it will broadcast the next presidential debate on 10 June on its most popular channel.\""
"\"As the protests against alleged media bias gather pace, Televisa has become keen to prove that its coverage is balanced. \""
"One protester at a recent demonstration carried a placard proclaiming: \"Not even my mother manipulates me like Televisa.\""
"\"Televisa then gave wide coverage to accusations that the protest was staged by non-student troublemakers.\""
"The current wave of protests against perceived media dirty tricks was triggered on 10 May when Televisa first ignored an anti-EPN protest"
"\"None of the other politicians named in the documents would talk to the Guardian\""
"\"Another politician mentioned in the documents, former senator Demetrio Sodi, said it was unlikely that the document was a forgery\""
"\"The files also contain proposals, budgets and promotional material involving several other politicians including Tom\u00e1s Yarrington\""
"The section which could prove most controversial refers to arrangements for payment, which suggest deliberate manipulation to conceal $"
"\"Media expert Ra\u00fal Trejo said the kinds of practices detailed in the document did not appear to be illegal under Mx law, but unethical.\""
"Mx politicians have long been criticised for spending lavishly to promote the achievements of their administrations, amid suspicion..."
"\"Asked if the state of Mexico had ever paid for coverage on Televisa, Pe\u00f1a Nieto's campaign team refused to comment\""
"\"The document was obtained by investigative journalist Jenaro Villamil who has always refused to reveal the identity of his source. \""
"EPN and Televisa suggested the document \u2013 first published in the left-leaning news magazine Proceso in 2005 \u2013 could have been a forgery."
"All three spreadsheets detail nearly 200 news reports, interviews and features... total cost of these services at $346,326,750 pesos"
"They include three Excel spreadsheets titled \"Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto: Budget 2005-2006\" apparently created at the start of his term as governor"
"\"Most of the other documents are strategies and associated budgets apparently aimed at promoting political clients through TV\""
"\"There was a strategy and there was a client who paid a lot of money,\" the source said."
"A former Televisa employee, who is not the source of the documents, told the Guardian that they attended meetings within the company"
"Some Televisa celebrities did just that, both on showbiz programmes and in the Mexican version of Celebrity Big Brother broadcast that May."
"The plan also envisaged \"promoting personal stories of crimes suffered [in the capital] by showbiz celebrities\""
"Longer-term strategies proposed to \"dismantle the public perception that Lopez Obrador is a martyr/saviour,\""
"\"The next day Fox declared a day of mourning for the pontiff.\""
"The document outlines short-term measures for controlling backlash, a period of national mourning for recently-deceased Pope John Paul II"
"Fox was facing growing criticism for an attempt to get Lopez Obrador, then mayor of Mexico City, impeached over a minor planning dispute"
"It was apparently created after midnight on 4 April 2005, hours before Prez Fox was reported to have met heads of Televisa and TV Azteca."
"One of the documents is a PowerPoint presentation which explicitly states its aim of making sure \"AMLO does not win the 2006 elections\"."
"\"De Lamadrid told the Guardian that she believed the documents were forgeries. \""
"Many of the computer files seen by the Guardian were saved under the name of Yessica de Lamadrid, who was a Radar employee and EPN's lover."
"A spokesman refused to comment on the allegations without seeing the files. \"We cannot give an opinion about imformation and/or documents\""
"\"Contacted by the Guardian, Televisa declined to clarify the relationship between Radar and the core company\""
"\"The documents appear to have been developed within Radar Servicios Especializados, a marketing company run by Alejandro Quintero\""
"Televisa, the largest media empire in the Spanish-speaking world, controls around 2/3 of programming on Mexico's free television channels"
"In a country where newspaper readership is tiny and the reach of the internet and cable TV is still largely limited to the middle classes..."
"\"The allegations come at a crucial time for Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the candidate of the ideologically nebulous Institutional Revolutionary party\""
"\"There is also evidence that actions suggested in the proposals did take place\""
"\"...extensive cross checks have shown that the names, dates and situations mentioned largely line up with events.\""
"\"it has not been possible to confirm the authenticity of the documents but...\""
"\"Payment arrangements suggesting that the office of former president Vicente Fox concealed exorbitant public spending on media promotion.\""
"\"The documents \u2013 which consist of dozens of computer files \u2013 emerge just weeks ahead of presidential elections on 1 July...\""
"\"Mexico's biggest television network sold prominent politicians favourable coverage in its flagship news and entertainment shows.\""
