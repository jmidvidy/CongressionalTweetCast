"Horford and Baynes have gotten away with literally a dozen fouls on Embiid"
"Brett Brown has still not made a single adjustment to open things up in transition. Have someone set a screen, try something."

"Lol at rewarding that Baynes flop. As if Redick could knock him down."
"Nobody moving on offense. Terrible, stagnant offense."
"Tatum should already have 5 personal fouls"
