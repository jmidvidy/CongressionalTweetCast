"10. Say he abolishes the Department of Health &amp; Human Serivces, because it's the only way to really end Obamacare."
"9. And say, on that January 21, Mueller still hasn't released anything. Meanwhile, Trump continues to do harm."
"8. Say it's January 21, 2018, 1 year into this illegitimate administration - and the 20th Anniversary of the Lewinsky scandal's break."
