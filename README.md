# EECS 338: Congressional Tweetcast

This is the source code for the final submission for EECS 338, Spring 2018 at Northwestern University in Evanston IL.

Congressional TweetCast is a Computer Science project made at Northwestern University in Evanston IL.

This is a tool for political and electoral research. How it works is simple: users enter in a twitter handle and select a specific congressional election.

This website will then deploy sophisticated algorithms to analyze the inputted twitter user's tweets, and tell you - the user - which candidate the inputted twitter handle will vote for in the specified election.

Our algorithms are built off tweepy, machine learning in python (more specifically text analysis through a Naive Bayes Classifier), as well as your standard web tools like HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery.
